### Hello World ðŸ¤“, 

My name is [Avimanyu Bandyopadhyay](https://www.google.com/search?q=avimanyu+bandyopadhyay) or simply Avi. I am a PhD candidate in Bioinformatics. Brought up in different regions in India, I hail from Kolkata. My interest in my current field arose after undertaking [a gene analytics project on autism and dolphin therapy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277961318_Computational_Studies_on_Genes_related_to_Echolocation_and_Autism_A_Comparative_Analysis_Investigation_based_on_Parallel_Computing) while pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science since 2014. I've been extremely passionate about research and learning especially since this time.

I started my PhD with an exploration into how Biofilms work that expanded into the study of multicellularity itself through [exploring](https://github.com/avimanyu786/CellModellerWithCuPy/) unique cell growth models via [CellModeller](https://github.com/cellmodeller/CellModeller). As my research has been purely interest driven, my work had to be self-funded based on my own savings on past work as a system administrator. To keep funding consistent, I took to part time scientific writing and started an [Open Science](https://itsfoss.com/open-science/) series [on It's FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/author/avimanyu/) as well as a [Rethinking DevOps](https://linuxhandbook.com/tag/rethinking-devops/) series [on Linux Handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/author/avimanyu/). Here, I've also worked full time as a Research Engineer for more than two years. Thanks to my past work as a system admin, I started authoring helpful Linux articles for the community. Gaming is also one of my favourite hobbies and I have shared my experiences about it as well on Linux. I've also had a humble opportunity to [visit Gamescom in 2016  at Cologne, Germany](https://avimanyu786.blogspot.com/2016/09/trip-to-germany-gamescom-2016-marksburg.html), due to my contributions in Ubisoft's "[For Honor](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/for-honor)" game community. Due to my passion in gaming, I've done my bit by writing gaming utilities and applications in addition to [simplifying scientific simulation work](https://github.com/avimanyu786/TrajectoryMergeAssist) on GitHub. Documentation of different software has also been an important aspect that I consider from a very early stage. So I always try to fill in and enhance any existing material that would eventually sound easier and simpler for community usage/deployment.

Eventually through my research life, as my work demanded more compute resources, I built my own [computing laboratory](https://www.gizmoquest.com/) while also writing [a book on GPU Computing](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-gpu-computing-with-python/9781789341072). In 2020, I submitted my PhD pre-thesis to my university in February. Due to the pandemic, my course got extended further onto 2022-23 while I continue to explore my research area. Since my original work started with a study of autism and dolphin therapy, I am currently revisiting and reexploring the same topic with the knowledge that I gained in all these years. At first, many years earlier, my perspective was based on gene analysis using GPU based parallel computing. Currently, I have shifted my focus on cellular and protein dynamics(with or without AI) to understand the same field. So my current work is on understanding the role of autism related cells/proteins and investigating the reasons behind their mutation and deletion.
