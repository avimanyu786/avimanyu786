👋 Hello and welcome, I'm [Avimanyu Bandyopadhyay](https://linktr.ee/avimanyu). You can call me Avi.

### Who Am I? 🎓
I'm a Bioinformatics PhD candidate from Kolkata, India. My journey began with a modest Master's project on autism and dolphin therapy back in 2014. I have been grateful for every learning opportunity since then.

### Why Bioinformatics? 🧬
My work started with a simple curiosity about dolphin therapy for autism, leading me to broader studies in multicellularity via CellModeller. I'm continually amazed by the wonders of biology and computation.

### The Systems Scientist 🛠️
I currently have the privilege of working as a systems scientist at NuNet, which allows me to build a platform that would have the potential bring computational solutions to biological questions. My past experience as a system administrator for two years has been instrumental in shaping my path.

### Funding My Dreams 💡
Self-funding my research has been challenging but rewarding. I've tried to give back by contributing articles to platforms like "It's FOSS" and "Linux Handbook" in my spare time.

### The Writer, Gamer & Musician 📝🎮🎶
It's been an honor to write for the Linux community and to be recognized as a [Ubisoft Star Player](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UBISOFT-ENTERTAINMENT-4719/news/Ubisoft-Entertainment-Who-are-Ubisoft-s-Star-Players-23200448/). Music also holds a special place in my heart, and I'm fortunate to be able to play the piano and drums.

### The Tech-Savvy Researcher 💻
I've built my computing lab piece by piece, documenting my journey in [a book on GPU Computing](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-GPU-Computing-with-Python). I'm always eager to share what I've learned.

### Open Source & Decentralization Advocate 🌐
I try my best to contribute to the open source community and have been exploring the potentials of decentralization through platforms like NuNet.

### AI Prompting & Search Engine Specialist 🤖
I'm fortunate to have gained experience in search engine prompting skills, allowing me to craft more effective queries in this era of generative AI. My existing GitHub repository, while not related to my AI work, is something I view as a learning journey.

### Ongoing Projects 🚀
As I continue my research, I've been able to revisit my initial interests in autism and dolphin therapy, this time with a little more wisdom and a focus on cellular and protein dynamics.

### The Journey Continues 🛣️
Though the pandemic has extended my academic journey, every day offers a new lesson and I'm thankful for the extra time to grow and contribute.

Thank you for taking the time to visit and learn about my work. Your interest is truly appreciated.
